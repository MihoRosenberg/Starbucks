The company's coffee shops serve high-quality and responsibly sourced coffee,  pastries, and sandwiches. They operate three locations in Fort Collins and want to expand into Denver. \n","\n","Your client believes that the ideal location for a new store is close to affluent households, and the store appeals to the 20-35 year old demographic.\n"," \n","Your team collected geographical and demographic information about Denver's neighborhoods to assist the search. They also collected data for Starbucks stores in Denver.
